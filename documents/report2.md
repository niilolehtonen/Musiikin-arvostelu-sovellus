# Report 2 ('VÃ¤lipalautus 2'):
* The application's user interface is in a good stage: Home page (including login), Registration page, Menu
* The SQL schema has been defined
* Login function has been implemented, although not fully functional yet
* Unfortunately, I have not been able to connect to the database, so logging in does not work in practice. It may be due to using a MacBook instead of the recommended computer. (Postgres.app has been installed and seems to be working)
* My first commit to GitHub was far too large, I committed several days of coding work at once. In the future, I will try to make commits as often as possible.
